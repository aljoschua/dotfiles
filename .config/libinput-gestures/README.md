# libinput-gestures
This is my configuration for [libinput-gestures](https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures).
I wrote a little [script](../../.local/mybin/libinput-gestures-switch) that can change the set of mappings by prompting the user for a config file and then reloads libinput-gestures.

Most of these mappings are actually outdated and I will probably update this some day.

The script for the xdotool can skip/dismis youtube ads when executed. It is assuming a Full HD resolution and that you're in full screen mode, though.
