# Bash configuration files

I use multiple files, essentially splitting up my bashrc.
.portable files are supposed to be sourced, even when I'm SSHing on another machine.

Common configs for all shells are kept in ~/.config/shell and are symlinked here.

Since I mainly use zsh nowadays, these configs are outdated and some of them are buggy/broken.
They still have some use for me from time to time, so I won't delete them just yet.
